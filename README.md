  This application allows you to get five random restaurants that fit your criteria(if you leave your criteria blank, it'll   be set to some default values). Then just swipe away two options, pass the phone to someone else, and they'll swipe away two more, leaving you with your restaurant choice!

Note: the root build.gradle file is set up to run with android studio beta 3.0, just change the classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.0.0-beta7' to an older one to run it on older versions.
